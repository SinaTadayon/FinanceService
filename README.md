# Marketplace Finance Service
This service manages the accounting of orders for different sellers within specific duration periods. It is designed for a microservice architecture.

The significant features include:

- Managing accountings of orders with MongoDB
- Using gRPC to communicate with other services
- Designing and developing a simple scheduler from scratch (using the ward/steward pattern)

Note: Please refrain from launching the service standalone due to microservice considerations in the design.
